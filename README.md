# Liam's Baby Blog

This is a website created for Liam Asher.  It is a place where family and friends can stay up to date 
on this amazing little man, and share any words of wisdom and love that he can read when he is old enough.

## Introduction:

I realized that Liam has a large spreadout family that would like to stay updated on
Liam.  How much he has / is growing, milestones he has reached, etc.  There is social media, but what about the grandma who has no idea how to use it?  Plus in today's world there is no telling who is truly on the other end viewing your child.  This will be a safe place where (once I learn some backend for username password protection, and the site will not be live hosted until then) only verified users can visit and safely view the content.
